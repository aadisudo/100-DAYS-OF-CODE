💯 **100 Days of Code – C Language Edition**
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code in C challenge!
For the next 100 days, I’ll be solving 2 coding questions every single day — covering everything from the very basics to the advanced corners of the C programming language.

🚀 From printf("Hello, World!"); to printing mind-bending patterns — one day, one step closer to mastery!

🧠 **What This Is About?**
This repository is my journey to sharpen my C programming skills — starting from scratch and gradually climbing toward advanced concepts.
Each day, I’ll upload two C programs, properly named, categorized, and commented for clarity.

📅** Challenge Goals**

✅ 100 Days of consistent coding
✅ 200+ C Programs (2 per day)
✅ Topics from Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
✅ Build a strong foundation in problem-solving
✅ Document daily progress

🧩 **Topics I’ll Cover**

Here’s a sneak peek at what’s coming up:

**Level	Topics**
🟢 Beginner	Hello World, Variables, Data Types, Operators, Conditionals
🟡 Intermediate	Loops, Arrays, Strings, Functions, Pointers
🔵 Advanced	Structures, File Handling, Recursion, Dynamic Memory
🟣 Fun Extras	Pattern Printing, Mini Projects, Logical Puzzles
